INFO: [Project 1-5578] Found utility IPs instantiated in block design D:/coding/computer_organization/exp/exp7/exp7.srcs/sources_1/bd/design_1/design_1.bd which have equivalent inline hdl with improved performance and reduced diskspace.
It is recommended to migrate these utility IPs to inline hdl  using the command upgrade_project -migrate_to_inline_hdl.  The utility IPs may be deprecated in future releases.
More information on inline hdl is available in UG994.
